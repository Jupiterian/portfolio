    "### Compare Yourself to the Beginning of the Year\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, I was a very different software coder. I didn't know JavaScript, and I had no real experience with coding in webpages. On a soft skills level, I learned how to meet deadlines, manage my time better, and test out my software before I committ. I became more thorough on deadlines and focus and appreciate these soft skills better.\n",

    "### Key Information from sprints\n",
    "Sprint 1: I learned how to set up WSL. I also gained knowledge in how the Jekyll site functions as a whole. I was also able to learn about permalinks, Jupyter notebooks, and javascript from the hacks.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Sprint 2: I gained a wide vast of knowledge in JavaScript. I learned about JavaScript syntax, how different parts of JavaScript (e.g. variables, classes, etc) work. These skills set the foundation for making the gamify quest in Sprint 3.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Sprint 3: During Sprint 3, I learned many things. Firstly, I learned how make an entire game, with little to no starting code. I also learned how to work with teammates, delegate tasks and collaborate. Also, I learned how to code properly with AI. After a few failed attempts, towards the end, we as a group figured out how to Vibe code with AI and heavily scrutinize it.\n",

    "### Night at the Musuem Reflection\n",
    "We had a lot of fun presenting our game to different people during Night at The Museum. We enjoyed hyping up or players to \"go big or go home.\" Presenting this game was a great opportunity to show others the hard work we have put in throughout the class. Although our game was quite difficult, one person was able to beat our game!\n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Additions - Given Time\n",
    "If I was given time I would make many modifications to the game. Firstly, I would add a back button on the page where the user selects the bet amount. I would also make the game a little bit easier so we could have more winners. Lastly, I would perhaps add a little bit information on how to play Blackjack, because a few people who attempted our game did not know how to play it.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What I want to learn next\n",
    "I would like to know how to develop full stack programs and services. I think software development is really fun when you have multiple different softwares, such as a database, a frontend webpage, and a backend AI model running together and you can give endusers a satisfying experience. I love working on such projects and I would like to work on them in the future. \n",
    "It would be quite intersting if we could learn more about how LLMs function, as these LLMs will become a big part of our future. Perhaps we could learn about some of the techniques these LLMs use, such as MCP servers, back propagation, etc.\n",
