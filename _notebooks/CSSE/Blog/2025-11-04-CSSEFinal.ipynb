    "\n",
    "On a soft skills level, I learned how to meet deadlines, manage my time better, and test out my software before I committ. I became more thorough on deadlines and focus and appreciate these soft skills better.\n",

    "**Sprint 2:** I gained a wide vast of knowledge in JavaScript. I learned about JavaScript syntax, how different parts of JavaScript (e.g. variables, classes, etc) work. These skills set the foundation for making the gamify quest in Sprint 3.\n",

I love working on such projects and I would like to work on them in the future. \n",
